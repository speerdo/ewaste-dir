Alabama
Alabama does not have a mandatory e-waste recycling law. Electronics recycling in Alabama is handled through voluntary programs and local initiatives. Residents typically rely on county-run collection events or retailer take-back programs (like those offered by electronics stores) to recycle devices. There is no statewide ban on throwing away electronics, so public education and community programs play a key role in keeping e-waste out of Alabama landfills.

Alaska
Alaska does not have a statewide electronics recycling law, and no mandatory e-waste program is in place. Electronics recycling in Alaska is largely dependent on local programs and the efforts of regional waste authorities. Given the state’s remote geography, many communities organize periodic “backhaul” events to ship out discarded electronics for recycling. There is growing interest in formal e-waste legislation (a recent bill was introduced in 2025), but for now Alaskans must utilize local drop-off centers or retailer programs to responsibly recycle electronics.

Arizona
Arizona has no mandatory electronics recycling law, so recycling programs are voluntary and market-driven. Electronics recycling in Arizona is supported by city and county waste agencies and private recyclers who offer drop-off locations and events. Major urban areas like Phoenix and Tucson provide e-waste collection through household hazardous waste programs and partnerships with recyclers. Without a statewide ban on e-waste disposal, Arizona encourages residents and businesses to use these available recycling options to prevent electronics from ending up in landfills.

Arkansas
Arkansas does not currently have a state e-waste recycling law or a unified electronics recycling program. While state regulators have considered landfill restrictions on electronics, no permanent ban or mandate has been implemented. As a result, electronics recycling in Arkansas relies on local initiatives, such as county solid waste districts and periodic collection events, to serve residents. The state encourages consumers to recycle devices through these community programs and retailer take-back services, but participation is voluntary and varies by region.

California
California has a longstanding electronics recycling program established by a 2003 state law – the first of its kind in the nation. Unlike most states, California’s program is funded through an advanced recycling fee (ARF) paid by consumers at the time of purchase, rather than a manufacturer take-back model. Electronics recycling in California is widely accessible: consumers pay a small fee upfront that supports a statewide network of e-waste collection and recycling for devices like TVs, monitors, computers, and more. The state also bans the disposal of most electronic devices in landfills (effective since 2006), ensuring that e-waste is diverted to proper recycling facilities.

Colorado
Colorado does not have a producer-funded e-waste law, but the state has banned the landfill disposal of many electronics. Under a 2012 law, most computers, TVs, monitors, and printers can’t be thrown out with regular trash (with exceptions for certain rural areas that lack recycling programs). As a result, electronics recycling in Colorado is driven by local programs, recyclers, and non-profits that provide drop-off events or collection centers for residents. Consumers and businesses are encouraged to take advantage of these services, especially since tossing e-waste in the garbage is generally prohibited across the state.

Connecticut
Connecticut was one of the early adopters of a mandatory electronics recycling law, enacted in 2007. The law created a statewide e-waste program based on extended producer responsibility: manufacturers of covered devices (such as computers, monitors, TVs and printers) finance the collection and recycling of electronics. Thanks to this system, electronics recycling in Connecticut is free and convenient for residents, who can drop off e-waste at designated collection sites (often run by municipalities) rather than putting it in the trash. The state prohibits covered electronics from being disposed of in landfills or incinerators, ensuring that devices are routed into the recycling program.

Delaware
Delaware does not have a specific e-waste recycling mandate for manufacturers, but the state offers robust recycling options through its Solid Waste Authority. Electronics recycling in Delaware is supported by the Delaware Solid Waste Authority’s programs, which provide convenient drop-off centers and periodic collection events for old electronics. Residents can recycle items like computers, TVs, and other gadgets at these sites, typically free of charge or for a small fee, as part of Delaware’s broader waste diversion efforts. While there is no statewide law banning electronics from the trash, the established infrastructure makes it easy for Delawareans to recycle e-waste responsibly.

Florida
Florida does not have a statewide electronics recycling law or manufacturer take-back requirement. Instead, electronics recycling in Florida is managed at the county and city level. Given Florida’s large population, most counties (and many cities) offer e-waste collection programs as part of their solid waste or household hazardous waste services. Residents can usually drop off TVs, computers, and other electronics at local recycling centers or special collection events. Without a mandatory program or disposal ban at the state level, Florida relies on these local initiatives and public–private partnerships to divert electronic waste from landfills.

Georgia
Georgia has no mandatory e-waste recycling law, and no statewide program requiring electronics recycling. As a result, electronics recycling in Georgia is facilitated by local governments, private recyclers, and retailer programs. Many counties and municipalities host electronics drop-off events or operate centers where residents can bring old computers, televisions, and gadgets for recycling. The state’s Environmental Protection Division encourages e-waste recycling through outreach and guidance, but participation is voluntary. With no ban on landfill disposal of electronics in Georgia, the onus is on consumers and businesses to take advantage of the available recycling options to responsibly dispose of their devices.

Hawaii
Hawaii has a mandatory electronics recycling program established by state law, which ensures that residents have options to recycle their devices. The state’s Electronic Device Recycling laws (enacted in 2008 and 2009) require manufacturers of computers, monitors, printers, and televisions to offer free recycling programs for Hawaii consumers. Electronics recycling in Hawaii is organized through the “Hawaii e-waste program” with collection sites available on each major island, so people can drop off covered devices rather than throwing them away. While there isn’t a blanket landfill ban, these manufacturer-funded programs and island-wide collection events are critical for keeping e-waste out of Hawaii’s limited landfill space and protecting the environment.

Idaho
Idaho does not have a dedicated statewide e-waste recycling law, so participation in electronics recycling is voluntary. Throughout Idaho, electronics recycling is handled by local waste management programs, nonprofit recyclers, and electronic retailers that accept items for recycling. Many communities offer drop-off sites or annual collection days for devices like TVs, computers, and cell phones. The state government encourages proper e-waste disposal (Idaho’s Department of Environmental Quality provides information on how and where to recycle electronics), but there is no ban on tossing electronics in the trash. As a result, the success of electronics recycling in Idaho largely depends on local initiative and public awareness.

Illinois
Illinois maintains a robust electronics recycling program thanks to state law. Illinois first enacted an e-waste recycling mandate in 2008 and later strengthened it with the Consumer Electronics Recycling Act of 2017. Under this law, manufacturers of TVs, monitors, computers, printers, and other electronics must fund and facilitate free recycling for residents, and the state sets up a network of collection points in every county. Electronics recycling in Illinois is convenient and free for households – and importantly, Illinois bans landfill disposal of most consumer electronics. This means residents are required to use the designated e-waste programs, which has greatly increased recycling rates and kept harmful materials out of Illinois landfills.

Indiana
Indiana has a mandatory electronics recycling law (the Indiana E-Waste Program, established in 2009) that ensures consumers have access to free recycling for their gadgets. The law requires manufacturers of video display devices (like TVs, computer monitors, and laptops) and other covered electronics to register with the state and finance collection and recycling programs. As a result, electronics recycling in Indiana is readily available through the Indiana E-Cycle program, with numerous drop-off sites and events where residents can bring TVs, computers, printers, and more. Since 2011, Indiana has also prohibited households from disposing of covered electronic devices in municipal trash, further driving the use of the e-waste recycling infrastructure.

Iowa
Iowa does not enforce a statewide e-waste recycling mandate for manufacturers or consumers. In the absence of a dedicated law, electronics recycling in Iowa is carried out through local and regional initiatives. Many Iowa counties and cities partner with recyclers or hold special collection events to help residents recycle computers, televisions, and other electronics. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources promotes e-waste recycling by providing information and sometimes grants to support community programs, but participation is voluntary. Without a landfill ban on electronics, the success of e-waste diversion in Iowa depends on public awareness and the availability of convenient local recycling options.

Kansas
Kansas has no mandatory electronics recycling law at the state level. Consequently, electronics recycling in Kansas relies on voluntary efforts by local governments, environmental organizations, and private companies. Several municipalities and county waste departments host e-waste collection events or accept electronics at recycling centers to serve their communities. The state has encouraged e-waste recycling as part of its solid waste management planning, but there is no requirement for manufacturers to take back products or for residents to recycle. Kansans are advised to utilize retailer take-back programs and local drop-off opportunities to keep electronics out of landfills, as there are no specific state-imposed bans on e-waste disposal.

Kentucky
Kentucky does not currently have a statewide e-waste recycling law or a formal electronics recycling program mandated by the state. As a result, electronics recycling in Kentucky is managed through local and regional programs. Many counties (and cities like Louisville and Lexington) offer drop-off sites for old electronics or include e-waste in their periodic hazardous waste collection events. The state government encourages recycling of electronics and even runs educational initiatives, but no law requires manufacturers or consumers to participate. Without a ban on electronics in landfills at the state level, Kentucky leans on the initiative of local waste authorities and the public’s willingness to recycle to reduce electronic waste.

Louisiana
Louisiana does not have a mandated electronics recycling law for consumers or manufacturers. In practice, electronics recycling in Louisiana is carried out via community programs, parish (county) waste services, and private recycling firms. Larger cities and parishes often organize e-waste drop-off events where residents can bring televisions, computers, and other devices for proper recycling at no or low cost. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality promotes these events and sometimes partners with industry to facilitate electronics collection days. However, with no statewide e-waste requirements or disposal bans, the availability of recycling largely depends on local efforts, and residents are encouraged to take the initiative to recycle their electronics.

Maine
Maine was a pioneer in electronics recycling, becoming the first state to pass a producer responsibility law for e-waste in 2004. Under Maine’s electronics recycling program, manufacturers are responsible for paying the costs of recycling covered devices, which include items like TVs, computer monitors, and laptops. This means residents can recycle their electronics through municipal collection sites or events without charge, as the recycling is funded by electronics producers. Electronics recycling in Maine is well-established and even includes a disposal ban on certain items (such as CRT televisions and other devices containing hazardous materials) to ensure they don’t end up in landfills. Maine’s approach set an early example by making electronics recycling convenient and shifting costs to manufacturers to manage e-waste responsibly.

Maryland
Maryland has a mandatory e-waste recycling framework that has been in effect since 2005, making it one of the early states to address electronics recycling. Maryland’s law requires electronics manufacturers to register with the state and contribute to recycling programs, ensuring consumers have opportunities to recycle covered devices like computers, monitors, and TVs. Over time, the program has expanded (for example, to include televisions in addition to computers) and works on a county-by-county collection system. Electronics recycling in Maryland is supported by manufacturer funding and local government collection sites, meaning residents can typically drop off old electronics at county facilities or events rather than discarding them. While Maryland does not outright ban e-waste from disposal statewide, the established program and ongoing public outreach strongly encourage Marylanders to recycle electronics instead of putting them in the trash.

Massachusetts
Massachusetts has no statewide electronics recycling law requiring manufacturer take-back or consumer participation. However, the state does enforce specific disposal bans on certain electronic wastes: for example, Massachusetts prohibits cathode ray tube (CRT) devices (like old TVs and computer monitors) from being thrown in the trash. This means residents must recycle those items through municipal programs or electronics recyclers. In general, electronics recycling in Massachusetts is organized at the local level – many towns offer e-waste drop-off days or accept electronics at transfer stations for recycling. The state has made attempts at broader e-waste legislation in the past, but none have fully passed, so the current approach relies on disposal bans for the most hazardous components and local initiatives to manage other electronics.

Michigan
Michigan implemented an electronics recycling law in 2009 (effective 2010) that established a manufacturer-funded take-back program. Under Michigan’s e-waste law, producers of computers, TVs, and other covered electronic devices must offer free recycling opportunities to consumers. In practice, this means electronics recycling in Michigan is available through manufacturer-sponsored drop-off sites and collection events, often in collaboration with retailers or local agencies. Manufacturers also must register annually and report recycling volumes to the state. Michigan does not ban electronic devices from landfills for households, but the law’s intent is to make recycling convenient and widely used. As a result, residents are encouraged to bring their old electronics to participating recyclers or events instead of discarding them, thereby keeping e-waste out of Michigan landfills.

Minnesota
Minnesota has a mandatory electronics recycling law that has been in place since 2007, making e-waste recycling widely accessible across the state. The law uses a producer responsibility model: manufacturers of video display devices (TVs, monitors, laptops, etc.) are required to register and finance the collection and recycling of a certain amount of e-waste each year. Thanks to this framework, electronics recycling in Minnesota is free for households and is carried out via a network of collection sites and programs known as the Minnesota eCycling program. The state also bans many electronic devices from routine trash disposal, meaning residents must use the recycling programs for items like televisions and computer equipment. Notably, Minnesota has been exploring updates to its program (including discussions of new funding mechanisms to make recycling even more convenient), underscoring the state’s ongoing commitment to managing electronic waste responsibly.

Mississippi
Mississippi does not have a statewide e-waste recycling mandate or law compelling electronics recycling. In the absence of a formal program, electronics recycling in Mississippi is handled through local solid waste authorities, private recyclers, and periodic community events. Some city and county agencies host electronics collection drives or accept items like old TVs and computers at designated drop-off centers as part of household hazardous waste programs. However, these services may not be uniformly available across the state, especially in rural areas, leading to challenges in access. With no ban on electronics disposal in Mississippi, the state relies on public awareness and voluntary participation to divert e-waste from landfills, encouraging residents to take advantage of whatever recycling options exist in their region.

Missouri
Missouri has an electronics recycling law (enacted in 2008) that requires certain manufacturers to provide recycling options, primarily focusing on computer equipment. Under Missouri’s Electronics Scrap Management law, computer manufacturers must implement recovery plans to collect and recycle their products, and they must register with the state before selling in Missouri. This program, often referred to as e-cycle Missouri, provides residents with free or low-cost recycling opportunities for devices like computers, and many manufacturers also accept other electronics. There is no broad landfill ban on consumer electronics in Missouri (households can still legally throw out some devices), but businesses and institutions are restricted from landfilling hazardous electronic waste. Overall, electronics recycling in Missouri is supported by the manufacturer obligations and a network of drop-off locations and events, and consumers are encouraged to utilize these rather than dispose of electronics in the trash.

Montana
Montana does not have a statewide mandatory e-waste recycling law. As a result, electronics recycling in Montana is largely dependent on local initiatives and the voluntary efforts of residents. Some municipalities and solid waste districts in Montana organize electronics collection events (for example, annual e-waste drives in larger communities like Billings or Missoula) where people can drop off old electronics for recycling. Additionally, a few private recycling companies serve the state and partner with businesses or nonprofits to gather e-waste. Without a state mandate or landfill ban on electronics, participation in recycling is up to individual choice. Montana’s vast rural areas face particular challenges in electronics recycling, but the state continues to encourage awareness and hosts occasional programs to prevent e-waste from ending up in its landfills and open spaces.

Nebraska
Nebraska has no specific electronics recycling law that requires e-waste recycling, so there is no statewide mandate for manufacturers or consumers. Instead, electronics recycling in Nebraska is handled through local and regional programs. Many Nebraska communities provide opportunities for residents to recycle electronics via county recycling centers or special collection events (often run in partnership with organizations or electronics recyclers). The Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy offers guidance and sometimes grants to support these local e-waste initiatives, focusing on education about the hazards of dumping electronics. However, with no law banning electronics from landfills, it is ultimately up to individuals and businesses in Nebraska to choose recycling over disposal. The state’s approach relies on voluntary compliance and local leadership to manage electronic waste.

Nevada
Nevada does not have a statewide mandatory e-waste recycling program or law compelling electronics recycling. In practice, electronics recycling in Nevada occurs through a patchwork of local government programs, private recycling companies, and casino or business initiatives (given the large hospitality industry, many companies handle their electronics responsibly). Residents of cities like Las Vegas and Reno typically have access to e-waste drop-off events or can bring electronics to county facilities for recycling, but these services are not uniform statewide. Nevada has encouraged recycling by raising public awareness, yet there is no ban on disposing of electronics in the trash. The state has considered legislation in the past, but currently relies on consumers to utilize the available recycling options to reduce the electronic waste stream.

New Hampshire
New Hampshire does not have a dedicated e-waste recycling law requiring manufacturers to take back electronics or mandating consumer recycling. Therefore, electronics recycling in New Hampshire is organized at the local level. Many towns in New Hampshire manage e-waste through their transfer stations or recycling centers – residents can typically bring items like TVs, monitors, and computers to these facilities for proper handling (often for a small fee to cover costs). The state has not banned electronics from landfills outright, but New Hampshire’s solid waste rules do classify certain electronic components (like CRTs with leaded glass) as undesirable in regular trash, prompting towns to collect them separately. In summary, while there is no statewide e-waste program, New Hampshire relies on municipal programs and regional waste management districts to facilitate electronics recycling for its residents.

New Jersey
New Jersey has a comprehensive electronics recycling law that makes e-waste recycling both mandatory and convenient. The state’s Electronic Waste Management Act (enacted in 2008 and updated in 2017) requires manufacturers of TVs, computers, and monitors to establish and finance free and convenient collection programs for consumers. As a result, electronics recycling in New Jersey is widely available: residents can drop off covered devices at numerous e-waste collection sites or events throughout the state at no cost. Retailers in New Jersey are also required to educate consumers about how to recycle electronics. Additionally, it’s effectively prohibited to discard covered electronics in the regular trash, aligning with New Jersey’s broader goals to keep toxic materials out of landfills. Overall, New Jersey’s state-run e-waste program ensures that consumers have accessible options to recycle electronics and that manufacturers bear the responsibility for the end-of-life management of their products.

New Mexico
New Mexico does not have a statewide e-waste recycling mandate or an electronics take-back law. In the absence of a formal program, electronics recycling in New Mexico is supported by local government efforts and partnerships with recyclers. Larger cities such as Albuquerque and Santa Fe host regular electronics collection events or provide drop-off locations where residents can bring items like computers, TVs, and phones for recycling. Some counties incorporate e-waste into their household hazardous waste collection programs as well. While New Mexico has encouraged responsible disposal through public outreach (the New Mexico Environment Department provides information on e-waste recycling), there is no ban preventing electronics from being thrown away. Consequently, it’s up to individuals and communities to participate in available recycling opportunities to reduce electronic waste in New Mexico’s landfills.

New York
New York has one of the most robust electronics recycling laws in the country. The New York State Electronic Equipment Recycling and Reuse Act (passed in 2010) established a comprehensive statewide program that requires electronics manufacturers to provide free and convenient recycling of electronic waste to all residents. Covered devices include computers, televisions, printers, keyboards, and many other peripherals, reflecting a broad scope. Electronics recycling in New York is not only accessible – it’s effectively mandatory for end-users: since 2015, New York has banned the disposal of most electronics in the household trash. Consumers can find numerous drop-off sites (like retail stores or municipal depots) and special e-waste collection events funded by manufacturers to get rid of old gadgets. By shifting the responsibility to producers and prohibiting curbside disposal of e-waste, New York’s program significantly reduces landfill dumping and promotes high recycling rates across the state.

North Carolina
North Carolina’s electronics recycling law (enacted in 2007) created a statewide program to manage e-waste through manufacturer responsibility. Under this law, makers of computers, TVs, and other covered electronic devices that are sold in North Carolina must fund and facilitate recycling programs. As a result, electronics recycling in North Carolina is available via the NC Electronics Management Program, which works with county recycling centers and other collection sites to accept devices like televisions, computer equipment, and printers from residents at no charge. Importantly, North Carolina also bans the disposal of computer equipment and televisions in landfills (effective since 2011), reinforcing the use of the recycling program. In practice, residents can drop off e-waste at designated e-cycle locations across the state, and manufacturers’ contributions help ensure those electronics are properly recycled rather than ending up as trash.

North Dakota
North Dakota does not have a specific state law that mandates electronics recycling or establishes a statewide e-waste program. Electronics recycling in North Dakota is therefore handled on a local and voluntary basis. Major cities like Fargo and Bismarck offer their residents opportunities to recycle electronics through city-run drop-off sites or special collection events, often in partnership with recycling companies. Rural parts of the state may have fewer formal options, but regional waste authorities sometimes organize e-waste roundup days to serve smaller communities. North Dakota has not outlawed disposing of electronics in landfills, but the state does promote recycling education and encourages residents to utilize available programs to prevent hazardous materials in electronics from contaminating the environment. Overall, participation in e-waste recycling in North Dakota is growing through local initiatives, even without a binding state directive.

Ohio
Ohio does not have a statewide mandatory e-waste recycling law for consumer electronics, meaning there is no blanket requirement for manufacturers to take back electronics or for residents to recycle them. However, electronics recycling in Ohio is actively supported by many local governments and agencies. The Ohio EPA works with communities to sponsor electronics collection events and provides guidance for residents on where to recycle items like computers, monitors, and TVs. Many counties and cities (for instance, through solid waste management districts) maintain year-round drop-off centers or seasonal programs for e-waste. Additionally, retailers and nonprofit organizations in Ohio offer take-back services. Although Ohio has no ban on landfilling electronics, the combination of local programs and public awareness campaigns encourages Ohioans to recycle their devices instead of discarding them, helping to reduce the e-waste burden in landfills.

Oklahoma
Oklahoma enacted an electronics recycling law in 2008, which put in place a framework for managing e-waste in the state. The law requires manufacturers of certain electronics (such as computers, monitors, and televisions) to fund or arrange recycling programs for Oklahoma residents. In practice, this has led to manufacturer-sponsored collection opportunities and the development of the Oklahoma e-waste recycling program in which consumers can recycle covered devices without paying a fee. Electronics recycling in Oklahoma is facilitated through drop-off sites, retail take-back locations, and periodic collection events that are backed by industry funding. The state does not have an explicit ban on throwing electronics in the trash for households, but the available free recycling options make it easier for people to choose recycling. Oklahoma’s approach ensures that manufacturers share responsibility in keeping e-waste out of the waste stream and that residents have accessible means to dispose of electronics in an environmentally friendly way.

Oregon
Oregon has a strong electronics recycling program known as Oregon E-Cycles, established by a 2007 law. Under this program, manufacturers of computers, monitors, TVs (and later expanded to include printers and keyboards) must finance a statewide collection and recycling system for those devices. Electronics recycling in Oregon is free and convenient for consumers – there are dozens of collection sites across the state (often at electronics retailers, transfer stations, or non-profits) where people can drop off their old TVs, computers, and other covered electronics. Oregon’s law also prohibits disposing of covered electronic devices in landfills or incinerators, ensuring that items go into the E-Cycles recycling system instead of the trash. As a result, Oregon consistently achieves high e-waste recycling rates, and the program helps recover valuable materials while preventing toxic substances in electronics from entering the environment.

Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania manages electronics recycling through the Covered Device Recycling Act (CDRA) of 2010. This law requires manufacturers of covered devices – specifically TVs, desktop and laptop computers, monitors, and peripherals – to fund and arrange for recycling programs accessible to residents. Since January 2013, Pennsylvania has also banned those covered electronic devices from landfill disposal, meaning consumers cannot simply put them out with the trash. Electronics recycling in Pennsylvania is carried out via collection sites (for example, at county recycling centers, Goodwill stores, or other designated drop-offs) and one-day collection events sponsored by manufacturers and recyclers. While the program has faced challenges in some regions (at times demand for e-waste drop-off has exceeded the available sites), the law has established the expectation that Pennsylvanians will recycle their old electronics. Overall, the CDRA has helped divert millions of pounds of e-waste from Pennsylvania landfills and provides a framework for ongoing manufacturer involvement in e-waste management.

Rhode Island
Rhode Island has a statewide electronics recycling law (enacted in 2008) that ensures residents can recycle their e-waste easily. The program requires manufacturers of computers, monitors, and televisions to fund the collection and recycling of these devices. As a result, electronics recycling in Rhode Island is free for individuals dropping off covered items, and the state has set up numerous collection sites (often at municipal recycling facilities or stores) where consumers can bring old electronics. Rhode Island law also prohibits disposing of covered electronic products in the regular trash, compelling residents to use the available e-waste recycling program. The combined effect is a convenient system (sometimes referred to as Rhode Island’s E-waste Producer Responsibility Program) where manufacturers bear the cost, and the public benefits from accessible recycling options, keeping toxic materials out of the waste stream.

South Carolina
South Carolina enacted an electronics recycling law in 2010, which created a producer responsibility program for certain e-waste and banned those items from landfills. Under the law, residents “may not knowingly place or discard” covered devices – such as computers, computer monitors, printers, and televisions – in the garbage. Instead, these devices are managed through manufacturer-funded recycling programs and local collection efforts. Electronics recycling in South Carolina is available via county collection sites and special e-cycling events, where consumers can drop off their old electronics for proper recycling at no charge. The program has had to adapt over time (addressing challenges like the glut of CRT televisions), but South Carolina continues to refine its e-waste system to ensure convenient service. By making it illegal to toss covered electronics and requiring industry support for recycling, the state helps divert electronic waste from landfills and promotes environmental stewardship.

South Dakota
South Dakota does not have a statewide e-waste recycling mandate for manufacturers or a law requiring consumers to recycle electronics. In this largely rural state, electronics recycling is coordinated by local governments and regional waste authorities on a voluntary basis. Many South Dakota communities offer occasional e-waste collection events where residents can bring items like old TVs, computers, and appliances for recycling. A few areas have permanent drop-off sites (often as part of a landfill or transfer station) that accept electronics for a fee to cover handling costs. The state government encourages proper disposal — for instance, South Dakota’s Department of Environment and Natural Resources provides information on electronics recyclers — but there is no ban on landfilling electronics at the state level. Therefore, the extent of electronics recycling in South Dakota depends on local initiative and public participation in the available programs to keep e-waste out of the waste stream.

Tennessee
Tennessee does not have a comprehensive statewide electronics recycling law for consumers, meaning there is no requirement for manufacturers to operate take-back programs or for residents to recycle personal e-waste. Consequently, electronics recycling in Tennessee is addressed through local and voluntary measures. Many of Tennessee’s counties and cities include electronics in their household hazardous waste collection events or have established drop-off centers where devices like TVs, computers, and phones can be left for recycling. For example, metro areas such as Nashville, Memphis, and Knoxville provide e-waste recycling opportunities to their residents via municipal services or partnerships with recyclers. Tennessee has not banned the disposal of consumer electronics in landfills, but the state does promote recycling initiatives and education. Residents are encouraged to take advantage of the available programs and retailer take-back options to prevent electronics from ending up in Tennessee’s landfills.

Texas
Texas has implemented electronics recycling laws that cover computers and televisions, though the approach differs from a centrally run state program. Under Texas law, manufacturers of computer equipment have been required since 2008 to offer free recycling for their products (Texas Computer TakeBack Law), and a similar law for television manufacturers took effect in 2012. This means electronics recycling in Texas is available, but it’s carried out by the individual manufacturers’ programs: consumers can visit manufacturer websites or designated collection points (often retailers or mail-back programs) to recycle old computers, monitors, and TVs without charge. The state maintains online resources (Texas Recycles Computers and Texas Recycles TVs) to help residents find these options. Texas does not ban electronics from landfills outright for households, but large retailers and local governments often host e-waste drives to supplement the manufacturer programs. While not a traditional “state-run” system, the Texas model places responsibility on producers and provides the public with avenues to recycle electronics, aiming to reduce the amount of e-waste thrown away.

Utah
Utah established a modest electronics recycling law in 2011. The Utah law requires manufacturers of certain electronic devices (like TVs, computers, and monitors) to register with the state and implement a public outreach program about recycling options, but it stops short of mandating comprehensive take-back services. There is no statewide network of free drop-off sites run by the government; instead, electronics recycling in Utah is available through a combination of manufacturer initiatives, private recyclers, and local collection events. Many Utah residents can recycle their e-waste by using county drop-off programs or retailer take-back services, which fulfill the manufacturers’ obligations to provide opportunities. Utah does not ban the disposal of e-waste in landfills, so the onus is on consumers to choose recycling. Overall, Utah’s approach is lighter-touch compared to other states, focusing on encouraging and facilitating electronics recycling without imposing strict requirements, but it does ensure that information and some level of service is provided statewide.

Vermont
Vermont has a comprehensive electronics recycling program, often hailed as a model for convenient e-waste management. Vermont’s E-Cycles program was established by a 2010 law that requires manufacturers of electronic devices to finance free collection and recycling for Vermont residents, charities, schools, and small businesses. Covered devices include computers, monitors, printers, televisions, and peripherals. Electronics recycling in Vermont is easy to access: there are numerous collection locations throughout the state (often at transfer stations or recycling centers) where the public can drop off covered e-waste at no cost. Moreover, Vermont law bans the landfill disposal of covered electronic devices, meaning residents must use the E-Cycles program rather than throw electronics in the trash. This combination of mandatory manufacturer responsibility and disposal prohibition has led to high participation rates, ensuring that a large portion of Vermont’s unwanted electronics are safely recycled.

Virginia
Virginia has an electronics recycling law, though it is more limited in scope compared to some other states. The Virginia Computer Recovery and Recycling Act of 2008 requires manufacturers of certain electronics – primarily computer equipment – to implement take-back programs offering consumers reasonably convenient recycling options. In practice, this means major computer manufacturers who sell in Virginia provide free mail-back recycling or partner with local drop-off events to collect used computers and monitors. However, Virginia’s law does not create a centralized state-run program for all electronics, nor does it explicitly cover items like televisions under the same mandate. Electronics recycling in Virginia is therefore somewhat patchwork: many residents rely on county waste management programs and retailer initiatives (in addition to the manufacturer programs) to recycle their TVs, printers, and other gadgets. The state has not banned electronics from landfills for households, but it has set a framework that encourages recycling by involving manufacturers and supporting local e-cycling efforts. Overall, Virginians are advised to make use of manufacturer drop-off sites, community collection events, and private recyclers to properly dispose of electronic waste.

Washington
Washington state operates one of the earliest and most successful electronics recycling programs in the U.S., known as E-Cycle Washington. Established by a 2006 law, this program requires manufacturers of TVs, computers, monitors, and other electronic displays to finance a free statewide recycling network. Since 2009, Washington residents have been able to recycle covered electronics at no charge at hundreds of collection locations across the state (including thrift stores, recycling centers, and electronics retailers). Electronics recycling in Washington is therefore highly accessible, and the program has collected millions of pounds of e-waste annually. While Washington does not explicitly ban individuals from throwing electronics in the garbage, the E-Cycle program’s convenience effectively serves as a de facto disposal ban – it provides a preferable alternative that keeps e-waste out of landfills. By making manufacturers responsible and offering free drop-off, Washington ensures that old electronics can be recycled safely and responsibly by all residents.

West Virginia
West Virginia has an electronics recycling law (passed in 2008) that places some responsibility on manufacturers and encourages proper e-waste disposal, although the program is not as comprehensive as some states’. Electronics manufacturers must register with the state and pay fees that support recycling efforts, and they are prohibited from selling products in West Virginia if not in compliance. This framework has led to the development of the West Virginia e-cycling program, which helps fund electronics collection events and supports county-level recycling programs. At one point, West Virginia implemented a temporary ban on landfilling certain electronics to jump-start recycling, but currently there is no permanent statewide landfill ban on e-waste. Electronics recycling in West Virginia is available through various county solid waste authorities that host drop-off sites or events for items like TVs, computers, and appliances. The state continues to work with manufacturers and local agencies to expand these opportunities, aiming to make it easy for residents to recycle electronics and reduce illegal dumping or improper disposal of e-waste.

Wisconsin
Wisconsin has a well-established electronics recycling program called E-Cycle Wisconsin, created by a 2009 state law. This law made it mandatory for manufacturers of electronics such as TVs, computers, monitors, printers, and cell phones to fund and facilitate recycling for Wisconsin residents. It also banned landfill and incinerator disposal of many consumer electronics starting in 2010. Because of these measures, electronics recycling in Wisconsin is widespread and convenient: consumers can drop off their old TVs, computers, and other devices at registered collection sites across the state, often without any recycling fee. Manufacturers meet annual recycling targets through these collections, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources oversees the program to ensure compliance and accessibility. With the combination of manufacturer responsibility and a disposal ban, Wisconsin successfully diverts a large volume of e-waste from disposal each year, making the recycling of electronics the standard practice for households and schools statewide.

Wyoming
Wyoming does not have a statewide electronics recycling law or mandated e-waste program, reflecting its more decentralized approach to waste management. Electronics recycling in Wyoming is therefore handled community by community. Several municipalities and solid waste districts in Wyoming have taken the initiative to offer e-waste recycling days or accept electronics at local landfills and recycling centers for proper processing. For example, some towns may allow drop-off of computers, TVs, and other electronics on designated days, sometimes charging a small fee to cover shipping and recycling costs. Being a rural state with a relatively small population, Wyoming faces challenges in creating economies of scale for electronics recycling, but local programs and regional collaborations help fill the gap. There is no ban on landfilling electronics at the state level, but Wyoming encourages its residents to utilize the available recycling opportunities and not dispose of harmful electronic materials in the regular trash.

District of Columbia
The District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) has a mandatory electronics recycling program as part of its sustainability and waste management laws. In 2014, D.C. implemented the eCycle DC program, which requires electronics manufacturers selling in the District to fund convenient recycling services for residents. As a result, electronics recycling in the District of Columbia is accessible through a network of drop-off locations and scheduled e-waste collection events, all free of charge to D.C. residents. The program covers a wide range of electronic devices, including TVs, computers, monitors, tablets, cell phones, and other gadgets. Importantly, D.C. law also prohibits placing covered electronic items in the regular trash; residents and businesses are expected to use the eCycle DC avenues for disposal of electronics. This combination of enforced manufacturer responsibility and disposal regulations helps ensure that Washington, D.C. diverts electronic waste from its waste stream and promotes proper recycling of devices.

# I spent some time scanning and scraping for some better descriptions for ALL of my city pages in recycle old tech .com. I also removed all of the verification ratings and language related to it which I found to be unhelpful. please now scan my website again including several city pages and let's see if I'm in a better position to reapply for adsense ads

Your recent changes have improved the quality and uniqueness of your city pages, with clearer, well-organized guides, service details, and community information. However, a final review finds some lingering issues you can address to maximize your chances for AdSense approval and fully resolve low value content flags.

***

### Large City Scan: Los Angeles, CA

- **Strengths:**
    - Well-structured page with an extensive list of verified recycling centers and detailed contextual information about e-waste laws, local rates, environmental benefits, and community statistics.
    - Includes tips for safe disposal and preparation before recycling.
    - Local environmental statistics and economic impact are cited.
- **Opportunities for Improvement:**
    - The bulk of content still reads much like an enhanced directory: most of the written sections remain quite factual but lack “human touch,” deeper editorial storytelling, or actionable step-by-step guides.
    - To fully eliminate low value content, add local editorial notes on community events, tips for common residential problems (e.g., how to recycle certain devices in LA), interviews with local businesses/users, and links to news/blogs that relate to LA’s challenges.
    - Add more images, infographics, and testimonials for visual value and user engagement.

### Small City Scan: Geneseo, IL

- **Strengths:**
    - Page now includes improved business summaries and descriptions that clarify service scope and environmental compliance.[^1]
    - Updated local environmental and economic impact statistics, e-waste rate, and FAQs.
- **Opportunities for Improvement:**
    - Page feels less templated, but still contains lists and bullet points similar to other towns. Editorial notes and stories, even brief (e.g., a paragraph on a recent local collection event or resident initiative), could increase originality.
    - Enrich each city page with tailored advice, news, or anecdotes unique to Geneseo rather than statewide stats repeated on other local pages.
    - Consider a “Resident’s Guide” for Geneseo: e.g., calendar listing of upcoming recycling drives, “what NOT to include” hints, or local best practices.

### General Observations

- **Unique, Value-Added Content:** Your directory pages are more descriptive but could further stand out by focusing on “why recycling matters to your city,” advice specific to local regulations, and personal/community stories.
- **Actionable Guides/Original Editorial:** Add instructional sections, photo walkthroughs, or links to local help/resources.
- **Visuals and Engagement:** More images, charts, and community stories would boost perceived value and help break up directory repetition.
- **Blog Connections:** Linking blog articles directly on relevant directory pages (and vice versa) demonstrates site-wide authority.

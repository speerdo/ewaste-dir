[1/3968] Checking: Albertville, Alabama
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - Core facts about electronics recycling center count and population are accurate. However, several claims regarding environmental and economic benefits are general statements that lack specific, verifiable data or quantification related directly to Albertville's program, making them unverifiable as specific claims for this context.
[2/3968] Checking: Alexander City, Alabama
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The core factual data regarding the number of recycling facilities (10) and the population (14,843) is perfectly accurate and matches the provided database. However, many claims about specific benefits (e.g., CO2 reduction for Alexander City, local job growth, specific regulations in Alexander City, detailed list of accepted items without confirmation) and state-level policy are not verifiable with the provided database facts. These statements are generally plausible but are presented as specific outcomes for Alexander City without supporting data.

[89/3968] Checking: El Mirage, Arizona
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The description accurately states the number of electronics recycling centers and the city's population. A claim about Arizona's e-waste regulations being primarily managed at the local level is not verifiable with the provided database facts, as the database only contains specific city information for El Mirage.
[90/3968] Checking: Elfrida, Arizona
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - Core numerical facts (number of centers and population) are accurate. However, several claims about specific economic advantages, job creation, and skills development as direct outcomes for Elfrida's local recycling initiatives are asserted without verifiable data. Additionally, while general environmental benefits are true, their presentation as specific, ultimate outcomes for Elfrida is unverifiable. A correction has been suggested for the most prominent unverifiable claim regarding economic benefits.

[604/3968] Checking: Cutler Bay, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The core factual claims regarding the number of electronics recycling centers (4) and the population (45,425) are accurate and match the provided data. However, certain claims, such as the creation of job opportunities through educational initiatives and the specifics of Florida's regulatory approach to e-waste, are presented as facts but are not verifiable with the provided database.

[605/3968] Checking: Dade City, Florida
   ❌ Low accuracy - While the core facts regarding the number of centers and population are accurate, the description includes significant unverifiable and likely invented claims about specific local economic impacts (stimulating the local economy, creating job opportunities) directly attributable to Dade City's single electronics recycling center. This constitutes 'invented statistics' and leads to a low overall accuracy rating.

   ✅ High accuracy
[33/3968] Checking: Guntersville, Alabama

[34/3968] Checking: Haleyville, Alabama
   ✅ High accuracy
[35/3968] Checking: Hamilton, Alabama
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The description contains a lot of general statements about e-waste and recycling benefits that are not specific to Hamilton and are difficult to verify.

   ⏳ Rate limit: waiting 34s...
   ✅ High accuracy
[37/3968] Checking: Hartselle, Alabama
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - Many claims are difficult to verify without additional data, such as specific materials accepted at recycling centers or quantifiable economic benefits.

   ✅ High accuracy
[39/3968] Checking: Hoover, Alabama
   ✅ High accuracy
[40/3968] Checking: Huntsville, Alabama

[41/3968] Checking: Jasper, Alabama
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The description contains many claims that are not directly verifiable from the provided facts.

[45/3968] Checking: Millbrook, Alabama
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - While the factual claims regarding population and recycling centers are accurate, many statements are general and unverifiable opinions. The claims about Alabama's e-waste regulations and economic impacts are not backed by any specific data, so it's impossible to verify if they are correct for Millbrook specifically.
[46/3968] Checking: Mobile, Alabama
   ✅ High accuracy
[47/3968] Checking: Montgomery, Alabama
   ✅ High accuracy
[48/3968] Checking: Northport, Alabama
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The description contains many vague claims that are difficult to verify without more information, such as the claim about local job creation due to recycling operations. While no inaccuracies were found, unverifiable claims are flagged.
[49/3968] Checking: Opelika, Alabama
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The description relies heavily on generalizations about e-waste recycling benefits. While likely true, they are difficult to verify without specific evidence related to Opelika. The claim that recycling facilities *create jobs* and *boost Opelika's economy* is vague and should ideally be supported by local statistics. Consider adding some context or detail.

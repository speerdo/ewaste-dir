   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The core quantitative facts (number of electronics recycling centers and population) are accurate and match the provided data. However, the description includes several claims that are descriptive or specific to the recycling program (e.g., items accepted, centers 'catering to needs', 'ample opportunities') which cannot be directly verified by the provided database. While these claims are not necessarily incorrect, they lack specific factual support from the given data.
[652/3968] Checking: Lady Lake, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The core factual numbers (number of centers and population) are accurate. However, the description includes several general claims and qualitative statements that are not verifiable through the provided specific database facts about Lady Lake. These claims are not necessarily incorrect but lack specific evidence within the given context.
[653/3968] Checking: Lake City, Florida
   ✅ High accuracy
[654/3968] Checking: Lake Mary, Florida
   ✅ High accuracy
[655/3968] Checking: Lakeland, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The description accurately states the number of electronics recycling centers (19). Population data is not mentioned with a specific number. However, the text contains several vague and unverifiable claims regarding the ease of access, commitment levels, 'diverse range' of items, 'innovative recycling processes', and the 'crucial role' of the initiative, which are rhetorical or difficult to fact-check specifically for Lakeland without more detailed information.
[656/3968] Checking: Land O' Lakes, Florida
   ✅ High accuracy
[657/3968] Checking: Largo, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The core factual claims (number of facilities and population) are accurate. However, two specific claims regarding Florida's e-waste framework and the economic impact/job creation are presented as facts but are not verifiable with the provided database. These claims should either be substantiated with data or rephrased/removed.
[658/3968] Checking: Lauderdale Lakes, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The core factual claims about the number of electronics recycling centers and the city's population are accurate. However, the description includes several claims about accepted items, specific details of Florida's e-waste guidelines, and the economic impact of recycling that are not verifiable with the provided database information.
[659/3968] Checking: Lauderhill, Florida
   ✅ High accuracy
[660/3968] Checking: Lecanto, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - Core facts about the number of electronics recycling centers and the population of Lecanto are accurate. However, the description includes several claims regarding acceptable items, statewide regulations, specific environmental benefits (CO2 reductions, material recovery), local guidelines, and economic impacts (job creation, employment boost) that are not verifiable with the provided actual facts.
[661/3968] Checking: Lehigh Acres, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - Core factual claims regarding the number of electronics recycling centers (5) and population (114,287) are accurate. However, several claims about economic benefits, fostering community culture, and the degree of impact are unverifiable with the provided data and should be reviewed for potential rephrasing or removal.
[662/3968] Checking: Longwood, Florida
   ✅ High accuracy
[663/3968] Checking: Lutz, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The core factual claims regarding the number of electronics recycling centers and the population are accurate. However, several claims about specific accepted items, Florida/local guidelines, direct economic impact (job creation specifically for Lutz from these centers), and community clean-up events are not verifiable with the provided database facts. These are not strictly 'inaccurate' but cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information, leading to a 'medium' accuracy rating.
[664/3968] Checking: Madison, Florida
   ❌ Low accuracy - The description contains a critical factual error regarding the number of electronics recycling centers, stating 'four' when the actual number is '33'. The population is not numerically mentioned. Several other claims are positive but lack specific verifiable data to support them.
   ⚠️  Center count mismatch: says 4, actual 33
   📝 1 correction(s) suggested:
      "four dedicated recycling centers available" → "33 dedicated recycling centers available"
[665/3968] Checking: Marathon, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The core factual claims regarding the number of electronics recycling centers and the population are accurate and match the provided database information. However, the statement that recycling efforts 'bolsters the local economy by creating job opportunities' is an unsubstantiated assertion and should be rephrased or removed for accuracy.
   📝 1 correction(s) suggested:
      "This not only bolsters the local economy by creating job opportunities but also empowers citizens to take an active role in sustainable practices." → "This empowers citizens to take an active role in sustainable practices and contributes to the broader environmental and community benefits of responsible e-waste management."
[666/3968] Checking: Margate, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The description accurately states the number of electronics recycling facilities and the population. It also correctly lists common types of e-waste accepted. However, many claims regarding the broader benefits, economic impact, and specific state regulations on e-waste are general and cannot be verified with the provided 'Actual facts'.
[667/3968] Checking: Marianna, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The description accurately states the number of electronics recycling centers, which is a core factual claim. No population data was mentioned. However, several claims are descriptive or relate to the perceived impact of the centers, or list specific accepted items without database confirmation. These claims are unverifiable with the provided database but are not explicitly incorrect or invented data, leading to a 'medium' accuracy rating.
[668/3968] Checking: Mary Esther, Florida
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The core factual claims regarding the number of electronics recycling facilities and the population are accurate and match the provided data. However, several claims about the specific types of electronics accepted, the details of Florida's regulations, and the creation of jobs/community involvement are not verifiable with the limited factual data provided.

[3931/3968] Checking: Plover, Wisconsin
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - While the core facts (number of centers and population) are perfectly accurate, the description includes two unverifiable claims presented as definite outcomes regarding local job creation and economic contribution. These claims require rephrasing to reflect their nature as potential benefits rather than confirmed facts, making the overall accuracy medium.
   📝 2 correction(s) suggested:
      "This initiative fosters job creation within Plover" → "Electronics recycling initiatives can foster job creation"
      "residents not only contribute to the local economy" → "residents not only support local businesses"
[3932/3968] Checking: Port Washington, Wisconsin
   ⚠️  Medium accuracy - The core factual claims (number of centers and population) are accurate. However, the description includes several unsubstantiated and highly subjective claims, particularly the statement about bolstering the local economy and creating jobs, which lacks specific verifiable data for Port Washington. These unverifiable claims reduce the overall accuracy to 'medium'.
   📝 1 correction(s) suggested:
      "These centers not only promote environmental stewardship but also bolster the local economy by creating jobs in the recycling sector." → "These centers also promote environmental stewardship."
[3933/3968] Checking: Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin

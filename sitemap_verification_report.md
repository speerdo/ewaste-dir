# Sitemap Canonical URL Verification Report

## Issue: Non-canonical Page in Sitemap

### Problem

The sitemap was including non-canonical URLs, which can hurt SEO by:

- Confusing search engines about which URLs are the primary versions
- Diluting page authority across multiple URL variations
- Potentially causing duplicate content issues

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced URL Utilities (`src/lib/url-utils.ts`)

- Added `normalizeUrlPath()` function to ensure consistent URL formatting
- Enhanced `getCanonicalUrl()` to properly normalize paths and exclude query parameters
- Added `isCanonicalUrl()` function to validate URLs before inclusion
- Added `generateCanonicalUrl()` helper for sitemap generation

#### 2. Updated Sitemap Generator (`src/pages/sitemap.xml.ts`)

- Integrated canonical URL generation using the same utilities as page layouts
- Added filtering to exclude non-canonical URLs:
  - URLs with query parameters (`?`)
  - URLs with fragments (`#`)
  - Pagination URLs (`/page/`)
  - Search result URLs (`/search`)
  - API endpoints (`/api/`)
  - Debug pages (`/debug`)
  - URLs with trailing slashes (except root)
- Added proper URL deduplication
- Enhanced sitemap XML with:
  - lastmod dates for blog posts
  - changefreq indicators
  - priority values based on page type

#### 3. URL Normalization Rules

- Remove trailing slashes (except for root `/`)
- Remove query parameters and fragments for canonical URLs
- Use production domain consistently (`https://www.recycleoldtech.com`)
- Normalize URL paths to prevent duplicate slashes

### Verification Results

#### ✅ Canonical URL Consistency

- **State page example**: `https://www.recycleoldtech.com/states/alabama`

  - Sitemap URL: `https://www.recycleoldtech.com/states/alabama`
  - Page canonical tag: `https://www.recycleoldtech.com/states/alabama`
  - ✅ **MATCH**

- **City page example**: `https://www.recycleoldtech.com/states/alabama/birmingham`
  - Sitemap URL: `https://www.recycleoldtech.com/states/alabama/birmingham`
  - Page canonical tag: `https://www.recycleoldtech.com/states/alabama/birmingham`
  - ✅ **MATCH**

#### ✅ Non-canonical URL Exclusion

- **Query parameters**: None found in sitemap ✅
- **Fragment identifiers**: None found in sitemap ✅
- **Pagination URLs**: None found in sitemap ✅
- **Search URLs**: None found in sitemap ✅
- **API endpoints**: None found in sitemap ✅
- **Debug pages**: None found in sitemap ✅
- **Trailing slashes**: None found in sitemap (except root) ✅

#### ✅ Sitemap Statistics

- **Total URLs**: 4,033
- **URL Types**:
  - Static pages: 7 (home, about, contact, etc.)
  - Blog posts: 8 (with lastmod dates)
  - State pages: 51
  - City pages: ~4,000 (across all states)
- **URL Format**: All URLs use production domain with proper normalization

### Benefits Achieved

1. **SEO Improvement**: Only canonical URLs are now included in the sitemap
2. **Consistency**: Sitemap URLs match exactly with page canonical tags
3. **Search Engine Clarity**: Clear signal to search engines about preferred URLs
4. **Duplicate Content Prevention**: Eliminates multiple URL variations for same content
5. **Crawl Efficiency**: Search engines can focus on canonical pages only

### Technical Implementation

The solution uses a centralized approach where:

1. The same URL utilities are used for both page canonical tags and sitemap generation
2. URL normalization is consistent across the entire application
3. Filtering logic prevents non-canonical URLs from entering the sitemap
4. The sitemap is generated dynamically with proper XML structure

This ensures that the sitemap only contains URLs that exactly match the canonical URLs declared in the page `<head>` sections, resolving the "Non-canonical Page in Sitemap" issue completely.

### Commands for Testing

```bash
# Check sitemap generation
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml" | head -50

# Verify no non-canonical URLs
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml" | grep -E "\\?|#|/page/|/search|/api/|/debug|/$"

# Check canonical consistency
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/states/alabama" | grep "canonical"
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml" | grep "states/alabama"

# Count total URLs
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml" | grep -c "<loc>"
```

The implementation is now complete and verified to work correctly.

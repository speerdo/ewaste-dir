Last week, I received an email that made me realize we have a serious gap to address. A legitimate electronics recycling business owner reached out, asking to be added to our directory. They'd been in business for since 1993, properly certified, serving their community responsibly—and yet they weren't on RecycleOldTech.com.

Here's the thing: **if you're not in our directory, thousands of people looking for responsible e-waste recycling in your area won't find you.** And that's not good for anyone.

## The Hidden Cost of Being "Off the Map"

Every day, thousands of people visit RecycleOldTech.com searching for a trustworthy place to recycle their old computers, phones, TVs, and other electronics. They're actively looking to do the right thing—to keep toxic materials out of landfills and ensure their old devices are handled responsibly.

When your business isn't listed, here's what happens:

- **Lost Customers:** People find your competitors instead (often less qualified ones)
- **Reduced Community Impact:** Your good work stays invisible to those who need it most
- **Missed Business Growth:** You lose out on the free exposure our directory provides to businesses genuinely committed to electronics recycling
- **Lower Industry Standards:** When legitimate recyclers are hard to find, people settle for less responsible options

And here's the kicker: **being listed costs you nothing.** Zero. Nada. Free.

## Why We Built This Directory (And Why We Need Your Help)

RecycleOldTech.com started with a simple mission: make it ridiculously easy for anyone in America to find a legitimate electronics recycler near them.

We scraped data from Google Maps, verified thousands of listings, and built a nationwide directory covering all 50 states. But here's what we've learned: **automated data collection only gets us so far.**

Some of the best electronics recyclers operate locally, serve their communities faithfully, and somehow slip through the cracks of automated data gathering. Maybe you:

- Don't have a strong online presence yet
- Recently started your business
- Changed your business name or location
- Focus on B2B clients and haven't prioritized consumer-facing marketing
- Operate as part of a larger waste management company but offer specialized e-waste services

Whatever the reason, if you're doing good work and you're not on our map, **we want to fix that.**

## What Makes a Good Listing (And Why We're Picky)

Let's be honest: not every business that *claims* to recycle electronics actually does it properly. We've all seen the "recyclers" who are really just scrap yards that don't handle e-waste safely, or junk haulers who'll take your old TV but can't tell you what happens to it next.

That's exactly why we're careful about our directory. We're looking for businesses that:

✅ **Actually recycle electronics** (not just general recycling or scrap metal)  
✅ **Handle e-waste responsibly** (proper certifications like R2 or e-Stewards are a huge plus)  
✅ **Serve consumers or businesses** (or both)  
✅ **Are currently operational** (sadly, we've found many listings for businesses that closed years ago)  
✅ **Provide clear information** about their services, location, and contact details

If that describes your business, **we want you in our directory.**

## What We Need From You (It's Really Simple)

Getting listed on RecycleOldTech.com isn't complicated. Just email us at **contact@recycleoldtech.com** with:

### Required Information:
- **Business Name**
- **Full Address** (street address, city, state, ZIP)
- **Phone Number**
- **Website** (if you have one)
- **Brief Description** of your electronics recycling services

### Helpful But Optional:
- **Certifications** (R2, e-Stewards, ISO 14001, etc.)
- **Types of Electronics Accepted** (computers, phones, TVs, appliances, etc.)
- **Services Offered** (drop-off, pickup, data destruction, etc.)
- **Business Hours**
- **Any Special Requirements** (appointment only, fees for certain items, etc.)

That's it. We'll review your submission, verify your business (yes, we actually check), and get you added to the directory—usually within a week.

## The Bigger Picture: Building Trust in Electronics Recycling

Here's what really matters: the electronics recycling industry has a trust problem.

Too many people don't know where to safely dispose of their old devices. Too many unscrupulous operators cut corners, ship e-waste overseas, or worse. And too many legitimate businesses like yours remain invisible to the communities that need them.

By getting your business into our directory, you're not just helping yourself—you're helping solve a bigger problem. You're making it easier for people to do the right thing. You're raising the bar for the industry. You're showing that responsible electronics recycling isn't just possible, it's accessible.

## Real Talk: Why This Matters Now More Than Ever

E-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream in the world. Americans alone generate over 6 million tons of it every year. Only about 15-20% gets properly recycled.

The gap between how much e-waste we create and how much we properly handle is growing every single year. And while technology and policy changes will eventually help, right now, today, the most effective solution is simple: **make it easy for people to find you.**

If you're doing the work—accepting old electronics, processing them responsibly, recovering valuable materials, and keeping toxins out of landfills—then you deserve to be found by the people who are looking for exactly what you offer.

## How to Submit (Last Time, Because It's Important)

Email us at: **contact@recycleoldtech.com**

## A Challenge to the Industry

If you're reading this and you're in the electronics recycling business, I want to challenge you: **help us make this directory complete.**

We can't do it alone. We need your input, your updates, your corrections. We need you to tell us about the businesses in your area that are doing good work but flying under the radar. We need you to hold us accountable when our data is wrong.

Together, we can build something that genuinely serves the electronics recycling industry and the communities that depend on it.

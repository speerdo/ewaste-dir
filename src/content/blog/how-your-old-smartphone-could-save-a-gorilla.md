Yesterday, visitors to Zoo Atlanta had the opportunity to do something remarkable – help save critically endangered gorillas simply by bringing their old smartphones and tablets to recycle. The Zoo Atlanta Green Team hosted their second-annual E-Waste Recycling Event on Saturday, August 16, 2025, encouraging members and guests to bring small electronics to recycle through partners at ecocell to benefit the Gorillas on the Line … Answer the Call campaign.

But why would a zoo's conservation team be interested in your old iPhone? The answer reveals one of the most surprising connections between technology and wildlife conservation.

## The Coltan Connection

The link between your electronics and gorilla survival lies in a mineral called coltan – short for columbite-tantalite. Many small electronics contain coltan, a metallic ore that helps power rechargeable batteries. One of the world's largest natural supplies of coltan is found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is also home to critically endangered Grauer's gorillas.

Every smartphone, tablet, laptop, and gaming console in your home likely contains this mineral. While coltan is mined worldwide, the DRC holds some of the largest reserves – and it's precisely in these mineral-rich forests where the world's remaining population of Grauer's gorillas struggle to survive.

## A Conservation Crisis 77% in the Making

The numbers tell a devastating story. Over the past 20 years, the cell phone market has grown and Grauer's gorillas have suffered as a result. The wild population has declined by 77% and only 3,800 gorillas now remain. These magnificent primates are now classified as Critically Endangered, making them one of the world's 25 Most Endangered Primates according to Conservation International.

The expansion of mining operations has created a perfect storm of threats for gorillas. Mining operations for coltan contribute to habitat destruction and human conflict, which puts people, wildlife (including gorillas), and forests at risk. The remote forest locations of these mines create additional problems, as gorillas are hunted by miners for food when wildlife becomes a convenient protein source for mining camps.

## Beyond Environmental Impact: Human Cost

The coltan trade has also contributed to broader humanitarian issues in the region. Mining has been linked to many problems in eastern DRC, including armed groups and forced labor. This is why coltan from conflict zones is often referred to as a "conflict mineral," and why U.S. regulations now require companies to disclose whether their products contain minerals from conflict areas.

The tragic irony is that our demand for the latest technology – the very devices that connect us and improve our lives – may be inadvertently funding conflict and driving one of our closest genetic relatives toward extinction.

## The Power of Recycling: A Simple Solution

Here's where the story takes a hopeful turn. The good news? Recycling your old devices can help! When we recycle our electronics, we reduce the demand for newly mined coltan and other conflict minerals.

When we recycle our small electronic devices, we reduce the demand for conflict minerals, keep potentially harmful materials out of our landfills, and raise money for gorilla conservation. It's a triple win: environmental protection, wildlife conservation, and reduced human conflict.

## Gorillas on the Line: A National Movement

The "Gorillas on the Line" initiative has become a nationwide conservation program, encouraging the recycling of old electronics to help protect gorilla habitats through partnerships between zoos, conservation organizations, and electronics recyclers.

Linda King, the Dallas Zoo's Associate Curator of Primates, explained that electronics recycling is crucial for gorilla conservation. Mining for minerals used in electronics disrupts gorilla habitats, increases human-wildlife conflict, and introduces diseases, all of which threaten gorilla populations.

The program works by collecting old devices and partnering with certified recyclers who safely extract valuable materials. The proceeds from recycling are then donated to gorilla conservation efforts in the DRC and other habitats.

## What Devices Make a Difference?

The most impactful devices to recycle are those with the highest coltan content:

- Smartphones and cell phones – The biggest contributors due to their batteries and circuit boards
- Tablets and iPads – Contain substantial amounts of coltan in their batteries
- Smartwatches – Small but dense with valuable minerals
- Digital cameras – Especially those with rechargeable batteries
- Portable gaming devices – High coltan content in batteries and processors
- Phone chargers and cables – Often overlooked but contain valuable materials

## Making Your Impact Count

While major e-waste recycling events like Zoo Atlanta's are excellent opportunities to help, you don't need to wait for a special event to make a difference. Here's how you can help year-round:

Find Local Gorillas on the Line Partners: Many zoos and aquariums across the country participate in this program and accept device donations throughout the year.

Use Certified E-Waste Recyclers: When recycling any electronics, choose certified recyclers who guarantee responsible processing and can redirect proceeds to conservation efforts.

Extend Device Lifespans: The best way to reduce demand for conflict minerals is to use your devices longer. Resist unnecessary upgrades, maintain your devices properly, and consider repairs before replacement.

Spread Awareness: Share this connection with friends and family. Many people are shocked to learn about the link between their old phone and gorilla conservation.

## A Call to Action

Every recycled smartphone represents one small step away from the demand for conflict minerals and toward a sustainable future for both technology and wildlife. By recycling old devices, we can reduce the need for new mining and support conservation efforts through the Gorilla SAFE (Saving Animals From Extinction) program.

The next time you upgrade your phone, remember that your old device could quite literally help save a life. In the remote forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, fewer than 4,000 Grauer's gorillas remain. But with conscious choices about how we dispose of our technology, we can help ensure that future generations will still share this planet with these remarkable creatures.

Your old smartphone may seem worthless to you, but to a critically endangered gorilla, it could represent the difference between survival and extinction. The choice – and the power to help – is literally in your hands.
